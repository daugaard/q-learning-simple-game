# Example of reinforcement learning using q-learning to teach an AI to play a game in Ruby
This example will show how we can teach an AI to play a simple game using the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm.

This is implemented in pure Ruby without any external dependencies.

The 2D branch has exapanded the game to be two dimensional and have random cheese placements. 

To run the game and play a human run:

```
$ ruby run.rb
```

To run the game and let the AI play run:

```
$ ruby run-q.rb
```

For more information about how this is implemented see [Teaching an AI to play a simple game using q-learning](http://www.practicalai.io/teaching-ai-play-simple-game-using-q-learning/).
