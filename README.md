# Example of reinforcement learning using q-learning to teach and AI to play a game in Ruby
This example will show how we can teach an AI to play a simple game using the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm.

This is implemented in pure Ruby without any external dependencies. 

To run the game and play a human run:

```
$ ruby run.rb
```

To run the game and let the AI play run:

```
$ ruby run-q.rb
```

For more information about how this is implemented see [more-to.come](more-to.come).
